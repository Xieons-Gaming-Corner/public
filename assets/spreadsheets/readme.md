# Pokemon Go Helpful Trainer Tools & Assets

Among the various tools, assets, and other things I do for the community, one of the little projects I (Dave/Xieon) have been working for is for Pokemon Go Players.  It will when finished consist of a full excell databook, and a markdown interactive library to track you catches highest iv, and more. 

I put this in the public/assets section so anyone may feel free to use my templates for their own use - and if you want to use markdown reach out to me and I can enable it through GitHub.
