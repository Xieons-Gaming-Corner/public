# **Protect Your Online Privacy**

Whether you are participating in protests or engaging in online activities, it’s important to protect your browsing habits, metadata, and search histories. These can be subpoenaed as evidence or expose others even months or years later. Even without a court order or direct governmental surveillance, your data history can be purchased from aggregate services, both legally and illegally.

On the internet, you are tracked everywhere you go by your ISP, advertisers, cookies, or the websites you visit. This tracking involves your IP address (a unique identification number per network), your general location, other places you have visited online, and often your social media accounts. Even your browser can reveal your identity through 'headers' your computer sends, known as a Browser Fingerprint. Due to the limited combinations of hardware and software, you might have a unique “fingerprint” because your setup is rare. For more information, see: [Webkay](https://webkay.robinlinus.com/) and [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).

Personal privacy on the internet has been compromised from various directions, including advertising and commerce, weak government protections, hacked databases, and products and services that leak your information (either by selling it or accidentally). Additionally, the internet was never designed to be anonymous. It takes effort to anonymize your information.

### Protect Your Online Privacy

If you’re engaging in research or online activities that shouldn’t be tracked, follow these steps to cover yourself, ordered from least to most difficult/serious.

#### Use Firefox
Firefox has recently upgraded its tracking blocking and data protection features, making it a better choice over Chrome.

#### Install Trusted Privacy Plug-ins
- [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
- [uBlock Origin](https://getublock.com/)

#### Avoid Software Without a Trustworthy Privacy Statement
Even offline software can send data without your knowledge.

#### Avoid Dropbox
Dropbox is not privacy-friendly. Use [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/) for file sharing.

#### Use DuckDuckGo Instead of Google
DuckDuckGo doesn’t track your searches: [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com/)

#### Use Incognito Mode
While not foolproof, it can confuse some tracking attempts.

#### Use Secure Email Services
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)
- [CounterMail](https://countermail.com/)
- [Hushmail](https://www.hushmail.com/)
- [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/)
- [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)

#### Use Burner Accounts
Create new emails with no personal info for new accounts and use fake names to avoid data mining.

#### Turn Off Location Sharing
- [Windows 10](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/13225-turn-off-location-services-windows-10-a.html)
- [Mac](https://appsliced.co/ask/how-do-i-disable-location-services-on-my-mac)

#### Avoid Using Credit Cards
Use third-party services like PayPal, or pay with cash or bitcoins.

#### Regularly Delete Cookies and Browsing History

#### Turn Off Javascript
This is a significant measure but can greatly enhance privacy: [NoScript](https://noscript.net/)

#### Use the Tor Browser
Tor routes your traffic through multiple nodes to anonymize it: [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)

#### Explore Other Secure Browsers/Systems
- Freenet
- I2P

#### Use a Proxy or VPN (or Both)
- **Proxy:** Hides your IP address but doesn’t encrypt data. Good for low-stakes activities.
  - [Hidester Proxy](https://hidester.com/proxy/)
  - [Hide.me Proxy](https://hide.me/en/proxy)
- **VPN:** Hides your IP address and encrypts your data. More secure than proxies.

#### Use Proxygambit
- [Proxygambit](http://samy.pl/proxygambit/)

#### Use an Anonymizing OS
Consider using a virtual machine that resets on boot, running on secure portable media. Use an encrypted key with Tails, ZeusGuard, or Windows To Go.

### On Phones and Other Smart Devices

#### Leave Your Phone at Home or Turn It Off
- Police can track phones via cell towers, confirming your presence or identifying you later.
- Messages can be intercepted by “stingrays” which mimic cell towers: [Stingray Phone Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker).

#### If You Use Android, Leave It at Home
- Android phones have a history of being hacked by police: [Android Police Encryption](https://money.cnn.com/2016/02/25/technology/android-apple-police-encryption/index.html).

#### Consider Bringing a Spare or Burner Phone
- Even without a SIM card, an empty phone that can connect to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth might be helpful.

#### If You Bring Your Phone
- **Think About Stored Data:** Delete contacts and messages that could put you or others at risk.
- **Back Up Your Data:** Ensure you can recover it if lost.
- **Set a Difficult Passcode:** Avoid using face or thumb ID, years, or simple sequences.
- **Turn Off Home Screen Notifications:** Prevent sensitive information from displaying without unlocking your phone.
- **Set a Quick Lock Screen Timeout:** Make sure your phone locks quickly.
- **Enable Airplane Mode:** This stops your phone from broadcasting signals.
- **Turn Off Airdrop:** Prevent unwanted connections.

#### If You Lose Your Device or It Is Confiscated
- **Revoke Access & Log Out Remotely:** Changing your account passwords can sometimes force a log-out. You can also do it manually per account—search “\<service name> revoke access for devices.”

#### Use Encrypted Messaging Systems
- Use [Signal](https://signal.org/en/): Police can surveil metadata (e.g., when messages are sent) but not the content of encrypted messages.
- **Turn Off Location Services:** This prevents attaching GPS coordinates to photos.
  - [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207092)

### Taking Photographs

#### Tips for Taking Photos
- **Take Photos Without Unlocking Your Phone:** This limits the data linked to the images.
- **Avoid Identifiable Photos:** Do not capture identifiable images of individuals.
- **Blur or Block Out Faces:** If you capture a person in a photo, ensure their identity is obscured.

#### Remove EXIF Data from Photos
- EXIF data includes information like shutter speed, flash use, date, time, and GPS location: [EXIF Data](http://exifdata.com/).
- **Screenshot Photos:** This removes EXIF data.
- **Delete Original Photos:** After taking screenshots, delete the originals.

#### Use Image Scrubbing Tools
- Use tools to remove metadata and blur parts of your image: [Image Scrubber](https://everestpipkin.github.io/image-scrubber/).

### Posting Photos or Information Online
- **Understand the Risks:** Posting indicates your presence. Never tag others without their consent or discuss private plans publicly.
- **Consider the Importance of Images:** Some images, especially those showing police brutality or critical information, may need to be shared. However, always consider the risks to individuals depicted.

By following these steps, you can help protect your privacy and the privacy of others while engaging in online and offline activities.
