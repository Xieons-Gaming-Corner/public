# ONE MONTH - 3 THINGS WORTHY OF CELEBRATION - 

Granted I'm very busy with everything already but myself and the staff here attempt to make the next month include some special content and experiences so that when the community hits milestones like this it's not - hey look what Xieon did - it's look at what this community has become - and as always I reward those who have faith in the vision i wish to create - have stuck around - and allowed us to reach the three milestones of celebration for the month of Febuary, for which we will be trying to make as celebratory as possible.

Thank you to everyone helped XGC finally reach Twitch Affiliate - this enables a lot of room for growth and improvement. First off I have a whole new sandbox to play around and dev in - I already have a Twitch Developer account and developer tokens, and I intend to integrate Raids and Trades alongside Twitch in the coming weeks/months. This is more difficult for me than Discord features - but now that I have the access to do what I want without limitation I should be able to have some cool features that are directly tied in with our channel points "XGC Sus Coins" - 

Thank you endlessly to the 1300+ people who followed XGC on Twitch - It was a difficult road to afffiliate because of streaming 24/7 - it was very hard to make the view average work out since there were long period were the bot crashed and there was 0 viewers, tanking the average - and it took a lot more time and viewers to move the average a small amount - I streamed several thousand hours - have 1300 follows, I only needed 50 - its the nature of the content. And whilst this shouldn't be exciting - the struggle to get to this stage when by all accounts we should've had it after streaming an entire month straight has been hard - but now that we finally have it , we can finally implement the following features to the streams:
> * Sysbot X Twitch Intergration
> * XGC Developed Proprietary Twitch Bot using Twitch's API to Sync with Channel points
**SUBSCRIPTIONS & AMAZON PRIME SUBSCIPTIONS**
> * You **can now support XGC by subscribing on Twitch** 
> * You **CAN USE YOUR FREE AMAZON PRIME SUB to Sub on Twitch to support us**
> * Link your Twitch and Discord Account then Claim the Linked Role because benefits for supporters follow you between platform - a Twitch Subscriber gets Tier 1 Discord Perks (you should probably link your YT too) Even if you don't sub following and watching the stream while having your account linked can give you bot passive bot buffs
**DONATIONS**
> * You can support XGC by donating with Bits, or by cheering with bits in addition to the other ways you could support us

## 1000 Members and Discord Partnership
We are getting very close to this, and as much as we would have liked to hit this milestone earlier, I have every confidence we'll surpass 1000 officially shortly and certainly by our 1 year anniversary - A milestone unlike the previous milestones - this time we're celebrating joining a new club within discord the 4 digit members club - And with that - we'll have the opportunity and will be applying for Discord Partnership - 

We appreciate all of our members - from the most active (check the leaderboard with %rank in #🏋➖trainer-server-level ), those who recently posted @✅Celebi (Recently Posted) to those first 100 members of which 88 or so are still members - @💰Aether V.C. who might have been lurking since they joined - but they are still here with us - 

We especially appreciate all of our @💖Premium Members 💖 - if you support us directly - through serveer subs @💖✅Mewtwo (SubTier1) purchase a #✅➖serverdex-project role @📕Original Dex Entry Author💕 are a @💖Twitch (Sub) 💖 or @💖✅ Sableye-Mega (Server Booster) 💖  it's because of you guys that we're able to pay for this expensive probject - but the return on investment in terms of Pokemon given out, raids hosted, friends made, and smiles caused makes it worth it.

## One year already for me of hosting - Come February 26th or so will also be 1 year this server has been officially functioning as "Xieon's Gaming Corner"

Of which - I'll take time to include this as part of the announcement - 
Thank you to all the users, those here still, and those who choose to continue their journey's with us at XGC - the time spent the past year has been an honor and a pleasure to be able to experience alongside each and every one of you. 

I will admit - I have had some of the worst experiences, and situations happen to me as a result of creating this server, running it, and even for simply being myself, and not a fake persona - I'm Dave - I lead this community and have experiences and interactions with hundreds if not thousands of people - which is why those few instances of what I just describeday be overwhelming but still get overshadowed by the positivity, and encouragement from members of this community - as well as the people I look up, people that have trusted me with their support if its just being a member in the server - to a friend - a best friend - a mentor - a fellow developer - I have had a year of some of the best experiences of my life - I'm able to relive my childhood - but with modern tech and a giant community - and I'm able to host, and run giveaways and tournaments - which I was doing at 15 for Gamebattles - I love doing this - and I am so lucky to be able to do, and have people support, what is by all accounts one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had - but the best - and literally a dream job - (yes I had to pay taxes for all the server stuff this year lol so its a job)

There's too many people to thank them all individually - but I will thank the people who their individual support played a huge role in allowing this server, nay, community, to reach where it's been: 

First I have to thank the XGC Co-Owner @r... - One of it not the first member - staff from the beginning - stuck by me no matter what - and should I drop dead gets the server assets - But Rich is among only one of the entire staff to simplify @⭐XGC Staff/Helpers (All-Display Role) ⭐  - I appreciate all of you for the various contributions, and the time you've put into making this community last, and grow.

 @p... deserves special thanks for the amazing artwork produced for XGC including the pre-production of 3d printed merch for our server store: https://discord.com/channels/829181609156411463/shop ```https://discord.com/channels/829181609156411463/shop```

And last, but certainly not least, those in #🤝➖xgc-partners

If you have a domain name from my website - it's obvious the respect, and appreciation I have for you without saying anything else. I recommend to check those 4 out if you haven't - additionally - some content is run exclusively for members of both Blaines and XGC, such as TCG Card Packs - being a member of both may be required for a small amount of our giveaways.

And finally...  @b... - I owe you a personal thank you, and i may not be able to ever put this properly i to words - But I've looked up to you for years - and not only have you and your staff such as @s... and @d... been some of the best friends I've made - you supported/treated me as an equal - put trust in me - and you've supported me in private when I ask things like "how do you manage the stress" - and I appreciate that someone as busy as you was willing to help me grow, play with your community in terms of giveaways, but help me in terms of a mentor - and I have, and will continue to be appreciative and have your back, as I have had, as we all continue on our own journey down similar paths -
