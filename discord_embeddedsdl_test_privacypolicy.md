# This is the Placeholder page for the Privacy Policy for the Discord Embedded Applications Test Bot

Abuse of the bot via attempted exploits, actual exploits, purposely delaying, or knowingly cause errors, are engaged in any illegal or dangerous.

This bot can currently be added to any server by anyone with the perms in that server to do so - there are no commands, and nothing interesting will happen. 
When we finally test him and finish we will revoke the bots presence in any servers it was in, and the bot will be deleted as it only servves as a test shell.
