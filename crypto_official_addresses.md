# The Crypto World is Rife With Scams: 

# What this project is: 
This is nothing more than attractive, sometimes maybe not so much, original character designs that take inspiration mainly from Pokemon - either new takes on the human characters, or a original character design, and outfit that is based around a certain Pokemon, it's style, thematics, mood, atmosphere, color scheme. 

Also - I run a gaming commmunity, a Discord server, am a programmer, a developer, a life-time gamers and FPS Fan - alongside Pokemon of course which I've played my entire life. I know the majority of the player base of noth only Pokemon, but of the other games Xieon's Gaming Corner focuses on highlighting such as
* Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links & Master Duel 
* The Yu-Gi-Oh TCG and OCG 
* Halo 
* Doom 2016 / Doom Eternal / All Doom
* Call of Duty - BO1 / Bo2 (Best Games) - Call of Duty Cold War - 
* Cod Zombies - 

And one thing I've come to learn over the years is that most gamers - most guys - enjoy looking at attractive depictions of anime styled females. Don't get me wrong - I can make attractive men as well, and will - and for some reason there's a large portion of my community who are into some freaky furry things - I got you covered as well don't worry.

This is a project thats main purpose is to fundraise small amounts of money off the sale of NFT's which should be seen as a donation to help a small group of Gamers continue to grow into something bigger, and better, and perhaps eventually dip my toes back into the world of professional gaming, something that once I got a taste of working with Gamebattles and Major Legaue Gaming in their infancy - I was addicted to - 

We may introduce some sort of rewards down the line for those who are in possession of the mintings at certain snapshot times - I would say whoever is holding on around Christmas will get some sort of Christmas present back from Xieon's Gaming Corner - 

## Official Links: 
The official wallet address for Xieons Gaming Corner, and it's associated NFT projects is: ``0x77971cD7525aA095435BDbE01A66f1a399c77fFC`` - This address is valid on the following chains: 
* Ethereum 
* Polygon / Matic
* OP 
* BNB 
* ZetaChain 
* Arbitrum 
* Avalanche 
* Base Layer 2 
* I'm sure there are layer 2 EVN's I'm forgetting that this address is compatiable with. 

> The official NFT Project is hosted on the Polygon / Matic Layer 2 Blockchain based ontop of the Ethereum Block Chain - The symbols for these two ecosystems are $matic and #eth respectively. 
> The project will initially be sold in the denomination of $Matic - however, if throughout the promotional sales we find a need to switch to $WMatic, $ETH, $USDC, or $USDT we will do so - 
> Our goal is to release the first few prints to gather hype at a cost of around $10 - 

## Again - This is simply a "creative" way to raise funding for our projects - 
* The cost of our server is a lot, as well as the upkeep of the server, the bots that run on it, development timme, the cost of cloud computing processing power, dev destress time, all adds up. We have big ideas for the future, and we want to be able to at least attempt to make them a reality, and not fall short before event getting to the starting line. 

* If you are interested in helping a small "indie" group of gamers continue to work on the projects they've been working for, and help their community, feel good about doing it, and get a dope 1 of 1 minting of an original piece of artwork designed by either Dave/Xieon (owner of XGC) or Mike (head of Graphics/Administrator of XGC). Second copies will not be minited - there is only 1 official collection - 

## CHANGES
> * If there are ever any changes to the addressses, contract address, issues with minting etc - it will always be relayed on this page - a direct link to this page which is publically accessable will be posted in the description of every minted NFT. 

## Full Disclosure
> * There are currently 3 existing NFT's minted from a different wallet - those NFT's will be reminted under this collection, the old ones will be burnt.
