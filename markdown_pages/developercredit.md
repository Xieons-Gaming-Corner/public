## Special Thanks and Credits: 
Tera-Finder Version(s) up through 4.0.1
* This project relies heavily on the use of the TeraFinder program created by [Manu098vm](https://github.com/Manu098vm/Tera-Finder). 
* XGC is not officially supported or endorsed by Manu; we simply use the generous code he's provided to the community in our endeavors. 
* * TeraFinder is itself dependent on [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX/).

The Rose-Garden / Not-ForkBot / Zyro
* Although XGC feels there is an unwarranted feud between "The Rose Garden" and "Xieon's Gaming Corner" since the XGC Admins were banned from the Rose Garden Server - we still want to thank the developers and contributors including Zyro for laying a large portion of the groundwork needed for our projects: 
* [NotForkBot.NET](https://github.com/zyro670/NotForkBot.NET)
* Zyro's GitHub: [https://github.com/zyro670/](https://github.com/zyro670/)

Sysbot.PokemonScarletandViolet (Berichan's Build)
* We have utilized code from [SysBot.PokemonScarletViolet](https://github.com/berichan/SysBot.PokemonScarletViolet) 
* Thank you to developer Berichan [https://github.com/berichan/](https://github.com/berichan/).
