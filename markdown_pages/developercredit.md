# Xieon's Gaming Corner Specific Projects: 
XGC has created it's own forks of several forks of sysbot, integrated them with each other, added, and removed things, used them as learning tools, backups, dependancies, and more. We'd like to specifically thank the developers and organizations of which their work we directly relied on to some extent.

## Special Thanks and Credits: 

### Server Owner-Partners
XGC operates heavily inside of Discord, and uses Discord as it's primary platform for it's community, content, and command and control of apps, and bot's. XGC has partnered with some other server owners, who allowed us to run, and test, our bots in their servers with their users -
