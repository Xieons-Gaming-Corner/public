1. Praise Breloom: The God of Sus
Many a battle, the Great Breloom - God of the Spore - has guided us to victory and swift defeat over our foes. PRAISE THE BRELOOM - THE HIGHEST OF ALL SHROOMS IN THE POKEMON WORLD!

2. Staff Authority and User Interactions
Please listen to the staff. Punishments and interpretations of rules are at the discretion of the moderators. If you wish to appeal a decision, open a staff complaint ticket for admin review. Conversations held in DMs between staff and users are considered invalid.

3. Maturity, Age Requirements, and Conduct
This is a mature server. We have an adult-only section for 18+ members with age-restricted content. You must opt-in to view it. You must be 13 years old to participate in any channel within the server, in accordance with US Law and Discord TOS.

4. Harassment and Respect
Harassment is taken very seriously on this server. We encourage friendly banter but strictly prohibit harassment bordering on criminal activity. Higher-ranking staff members have the power to overrule decisions, but arguing with staff is not permitted.

5. Reporting Incidents and Communication
If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in any situation, open a support ticket. All staff can access support tickets by default. If you have an issue with a specific staff member, inform Rich or myself privately, and we'll restrict access to the ticket to only admins.

6. Advertising, Self-Promotion, and Suggestions
Advertising will be addressed case-by-case. Self-promotion may be allowed, provided you open a ticket and discuss it with staff first. Advertising without staff consultation will be treated as a violation. If you have suggestions, submit your ideas through a support ticket.

7. Selling Pokémon, Violating Partnered Servers' Rules, and Zero-Tolerance
Selling Pokémon acquired through XGC or our partnered servers is absolutely unacceptable. Violations of XGC's Partners and Friends Servers will result in punishment within our server as well. We hold a zero-tolerance stance for violations of hard-line policies.

8. New Roles, Role Set Assistance, and Exclusive Bot Rules
Introducing two new roles—Bot Enthusiasts and Banned from Bot. Every user interacting with our bots will eventually require one of these roles. If you encounter challenges obtaining these roles or have questions, open a support ticket. There will be a future cutoff for users to claim the Bot Enthusiast role.

9. Phone Verification, Minimum Age Requirements, and Mature Content
Due to past severe situations, XGC's staff has implemented a phone verification system. The server has a minimum age limit of 13 to comply with US Law. This server features mature content, with channels ranging from PG13 to 17-rated content. There will be swearing, banter, etc.

10. Giveaway Rules and Staff Winning Lotteries
All members are eligible for giveaways. To claim your prize, collect it or open a prize claim support ticket within 48 hours of the giveaway ending. If a staff member wins a giveaway, we will strive to provide that staff member with a copy of the prize, along with another user. We will indicate in the giveaway announcement if this is the case.

11. Staff in Tournaments and Competitive Environment
Owner and staff members are welcome to participate in tournaments. Skill is the determining factor. Fair play is emphasized, and Pokémon tournaments follow guidelines to ensure an inclusive competitive environment.

12. Fair Play and Pokémon Tournaments
The community is dedicated to fostering a fair and inclusive competitive environment for all Pokémon trainers. "Generated" Pokémon for personal matches are allowed, as long as both participants agree. However, "generated" Pokémon are prohibited in official tournaments to align with Terms of Service and tournament policies.

13. Community Values: Cooperation and Participation
Two important cornerstones are helping each other and refraining from greed or entitlement. Cooperation and participation are valued, and behavior contradicting these values may result in punitive action.

14. Respecting Others' Time
Not respecting others' time, such as asking for help and not following advice, may result in a timeout and a temporary loss of bot privileges. Staff members have the right to take action if their time is wasted.

15. Disputes and Ticket Resolution
If you have issues or disputes, open a support ticket. Staff will address your concerns in a ticket, and communication through DMs with staff is discouraged. Ticket communication ensures transparency and proper resolution.

16. Ownership Verification and Permissions
For certain commands or actions, ownership verification may be required. Ensure the owner's Discord ID matches the one specified in the designated file. Unauthorized access may result in consequences.

17. Discord Server Rules Repository
All rules and guidelines are available in a public repository on GitHub for transparency and accessibility. Users are encouraged to review and understand these rules for a positive community experience.

18. External Links and Resources
Sharing external links or resources must align with the server's ethos. Consideration should be given to the content's relevance, appropriateness, and potential impact on the community.

19. Server-Related Discussions and Feedback
Discussions about server-related matters and feedback should be directed to the appropriate channels or support tickets. Public discussions ensure community involvement, and constructive feedback is valued.

20. Bot Commands and Usage
Users are encouraged to explore and use bots within the designated channels. However, misuse, spam, or disruptive bot behavior may result in warnings or restrictions. Familiarize yourself with bot-specific rules and guidelines.
